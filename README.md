# BatteryDataProcessing

This repository containens data converting and processing files for regular battery testing data processing.

a battery testing usually includes 3 parts:
1. Data Ingestion
2. Data Shaping
3. Data Mining

This repository aims to the first phase __Data Ingestion__

In battery testing, there usually will be various machines used. This causes the source format of tesing data may not be directly imported to DBMS.
here's 3 file formats you may meet and the related solutions.

## NDA file
NDA2CSV code : /src/NDA2CSVTest
NDA file is generated by Neware Battery's battery testing device. It uses it's own format and can only be read, export to Excel/CSV by their own software(BSDAP). 
We use UIAutomation to launch BSDAP and export data to a specified file. you can find source code at /src/NDA2CSVTest

## DAT file
DAT file is actully a TSV file with 28 rows as file head. we can easily load the DAT file via ADF with by setting dataset rowskip to 28.

## EXCEL file
the excel file usually contains 2 primary data sheet ("details","statics"), it is easy to load excel to synapse pool via ADF.
